# Week 01

I took a risk and dove into something that terrifies me. I quit my job and decided to embark on a journey to better myself and learn a new skill.
Week one of class was a little rough but I made it through. Around day 3 I felt lost but I'm learning to not second guess myself so much. We are learning python and I have to say, it's really cool. I'm proud of myself for taking this leap and working towards something that will open so many doors. Week one was a lot of information and a lot of emotions, frustrastration with myself being one of the biggest emotions. This is a reminder, BE KIND TO YOURSELF! FOCUS! PUSH THROUGH! YOU CAN DO THIS!
Everything is new and intense but also exciting and interesting. One foot in front of the other. Stay focused and don't give up.
