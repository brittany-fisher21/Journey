Week 4 was rough but I made it. Being kinder to myself was difficult this week. Frustration set in a few times and I had to dig deep to make sure I didn't give up. Javascript was more complicated than python. Often times I felt like I was confusing syntax between Javascript and python. 
I did spend more time working together with my classmates and it was a relief to see that we all had struggles, just in different areas. Regardless of how difficult this week is, I'm really looking forward to the front-end project. The class ahead of us said that everything came together for them once they started the project, I'm hopeful for the same thing. 
I'm still here and pushing through! 
Reminder, Be kind to yourself, no matter how difficult that may seem. Don't give up! Keep pushing! You've got this!
