#Week 3

I did it! One more week down. 
Things are slowly starting to come together but not full circle just yet. We watched another class present their front-end projects and they were amazing!!! I was shocked that we will be doing that in just a few weeks. I'm nervous but also excited. Html and CSS seem like a lot of plug and play, no real memorization, but I could be wrong lol. It's still early. I'm opening up and speaking to more of my classmates so thats a step for me. I'm a loner and love to be alone but I'm realizing that communication, communication, communication is key lol. 

We were assigned to clone our favorite websites and I scrapped so many ideas before I decided to recreate one of my favorite YouTube Lofi channels. I'm working on that and my grimm fairytales site simultaniously. I figure that I can swap ideas from them and build something pretty cool. We took a look at dribbble and I'm honestly not too sure how to implement what I saw into CSS but this weekend is a coding weekend for me so I'll see what I come up with.

I'm super proud of me. I have my weaknesses but so does everyone else. I'm working on not comparing myself to other people. Sometimes I jump in groups with people and still feel like I'm holding them back if I ask questions but Sean mentioned this week that the only competition we truly have is ourselves and I've been trying to stick with that. I'm trying not to see competition, only assets and teammates. I think we are all still warming up with each other. I think these front-end projects are going to have us all open up way more. 
I hope the spelling nemesis didn't attack me while writing this lol. 

Keep pushing! Keep trying! Don't give up! BE KIND TO YOURSELF!
I've got this!
