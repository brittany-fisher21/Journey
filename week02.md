Week 02
I made it through week 2! We had group python projects to tackle and I'll admit I was nervous and scared that I wouldn't know the least bit of what I was doing. I was afraid that I wouldn't accomplish anything or be able to create anything at all....but I did. I designed a dictionary that didn't make it into our final code but I was proud of myself for trying. I created a dictionary of super hero's and villian's characteristics, equiptment they are famous for, and catchphrases. I was so excited to finally take a step back and look at what I had done. We are finished with python and are moving into html during week 3. One language down and a few more to go lol. I'm proud of me. No matter how hard things get Bri, just remember to keep pushing, keep trying, never give up, and be kind to yourself. You've got this! So far I feel great and confident. Lets see how week 3 goes, and no matter what, you came this far!
